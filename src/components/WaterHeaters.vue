      A water heater is a home appliance that most people use on a daily basis
      without giving it much thought. Itâ€™s only when there is a problem with the
      water heater that people realize just how important it is. The water
      heater is responsible for providing hot water for showers, laundry and
      dishes.

      How does a water heater work? A water heater consists of a tank where the
      water is heated and stored. The tank is usually insulated to keep the
      water hot for long periods of time. When you turn on the hot water tap,
      the cold water enters the tank and is heated by either an electric element
      or a gas burner. The hot water then rises to the top of the tank and is
      supplied to your taps.
